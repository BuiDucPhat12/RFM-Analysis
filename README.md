### 1.1 Business question
- SuperStore Company is a global retail company with a large customer base. For the upcoming Christmas and New Year season, the Marketing department intends to launch marketing campaigns to appreciate customers who have supported the company over time, as well as to target potential customers who could become loyal patrons.
- However, the Marketing department hasn't yet segmented this year's customers because the dataset is too vast to handle manually, unlike in previous years. They are seeking assistance from the Data Analytics department to implement a customer segmentation task to tailor marketing campaigns to different customer groups.
- With the retail model of Superstore company, which indicator should be most focused in the 3 indicators R,F, and M?
